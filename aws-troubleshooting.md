### Troubleshooting steps

Use this section to read about known issues and for common troubleshooting steps for AWS CloudFormation deployments. 

  - In a case of stack creation failures, disabling rollback allows you to preview events for each provisioned resource as well as preview cf-init.log; see [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-init.html#cfn-init-Examples) for more details.
  - There are several common reasons for deployment failure: 
    * Missing pre-request: see the "Prerequisites" section for a particular AWS CloudFormation Template. See [example](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/supported/standalone/1nic/existing-stack/payg/README.md#prerequisites) for more details.
    * Missing required parameters; see the "Template parameters" section for the complete list of template parameters required for a particular AWS CloudFormation Template; see [example](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/supported/standalone/1nic/existing-stack/payg/README.md#user-content-installing-the-image-using-the-aws-launch-stack-button) for more details.
    * Missing required resources/infastruture; existent stack templates require existent infastructure.
    * Lack of permissions for IAM user used for CloudFormation deployment.
    * Template validation problem; using the [validate-template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/validate-template.html) method allows you to validate the template against AWS.
  - AWS Docs provide additional details on possible resolutions of common AWS problems [AWS Docs Troubleshooing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors).
  - If you recieve a deployment failure during BIG-IP onboarding, the BIG-IP service logs allow you to get insights into the problem: 
    * /var/log/restnoded/restnoded.log - [AS3](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/userguide/about-as3.html) error log
    * /var/log/restjavad.[0-9].log - restjavad logs; this service provides control plane access to the BIG-IP using an http REST API.
    * /var/log/cloud/aws/ - this directory includes logs generated by [f5-cloud-libs](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-cloud-libs) tool intended for onboarding and configuring the BIG-IP device; the [f5-cloud-libs](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-cloud-libs/blob/master/USAGE.md) page provides details about each module used by f5-cloud-libs
