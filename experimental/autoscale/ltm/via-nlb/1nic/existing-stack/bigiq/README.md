## Introduction
This experimental solution implements auto scaling of BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) LTM systems in Amazon Web Services, using a [BIG-IQ device](https://f5.com/products/big-iq-centralized-management) with a pool of BIG-IP licenses in order to license BIG-IP VEs using BYOL licenses.  

This is an *existing stack* template, meaning the networking infrastructure MUST be available prior to deploying. See the Template Parameters Section for required networking objects.

Auto scaling means that as traffic through the BIG-IP VE or the BIG-IP CPU utilization increases or decreases, the number of BIG-IP VE LTM instances automatically increases or decreases accordingly (based on values you enter in the template). The BIG-IP VEs have the <a href="https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm">Local Traffic Manager</a> (LTM) module enabled to provide advanced traffic management functionality.


See our [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ3IgGWsePs) to see a similar template in action.  For information on getting started using F5's CFT templates on GitHub, see [Amazon Web Services: Solutions 101](http://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/aws/AWS_solutions101.html).


## Prerequisites
The following are prerequisites for this solution:
 - The appropriate permission in AWS to launch CloudFormation (CFT) templates. You must be using an IAM user with the AdministratorAccess policy attached and have permission to create Auto Scale Groups, S3 Buckets, Instances, and IAM Instance Profiles.  For details on permissions and all AWS configuration, see https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/.
 - An existing AWS VPC with a public subnet, a Network load balancer (NLB) with target groups in front of the BIG-IP VE(s), and a DNS name for the application pool or if using service discovery, the key and value tags. 
   - The subnet for the management network requires a route and access to the Internet for the initial configuration to download the BIG-IP cloud library. 
 - Access to BIG-IP images in the Amazon region within which you are working.
 - Accepted the EULA for all Images in the AWS marketplace. If you have not deployed BIG-IP VE in your environment before, search for F5 in the Marketplace and then click **Accept Software Terms**.  This only appears the first time you attempt to launch an F5 image.
 - Key pair for management access to BIG-IP VE (you can create or import the key pair in AWS), see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/upload-server-certificate.html for information.
 -	BIG-IQ prerequisites:
    - This solution supports the two most recent versions of BIG-IQ (see the [Version Matrix](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/aws-bigip-version-matrix.md) for specific versions).
    - The templates now support BIG-IQ licensing using an [ELA](https://www.f5.com/pdf/licensing/big-ip-virtual-edition-enterprise-licensing-agreement-overview.pdf)/subscription pool, which enables self-licensing of BIG-IP virtual editions (VEs).
    -	You must have a pool of BIG-IP VE licenses on your BIG-IQ device. Only Registration Key and ELA/subscription pools are supported.  See the [BIG-IQ documentation](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-iq-centralized-mgmt/manuals/product/bigiq-central-mgmt-device-5-3-0/3.html) for more detailed information on License pool types.
    -	Your BIG-IQ system must have at least [2 NICs](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-iq-centralized-mgmt/manuals/product/big-iq-central-mgmt-amazon-web-services-setup-5-2-0/1.html#guid-bd42a26b-9fa6-4127-88ab-fe5ab06bd3c2).
    - You must have your BIG-IQ password (only, no other content) in a file in your S3 bucket. The template asks for the full path to this file.
    - We strongly recommend you set the AWS user account permissions for the S3 bucket and the object containing the BIG-IQ password to **Read, Write** only.  Do **NOT** enable public permissions for *Any authenticated user* or *Everyone*.
 
## Important configuration notes
 - All F5 CloudFormation templates include Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) v3.18.0 on the BIG-IP VE.  As of release 4.1.2, all supported templates give the option of including the URL of an AS3 declaration, which you can use to specify the BIG-IP configuration you want on your newly created BIG-IP VE(s).  In templates such as autoscale, where an F5-recommended configuration is deployed by default, specifying an AS3 declaration URL will override the default configuration with your declaration.   See the [AS3 documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/) for details on how to use AS3.  
 - The **sa-east** region does not support using the **m4.xlarge** instance size. If you are using that region, you must select a different instance size. For a list of supported instances and regions, see https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/tree/master/AMI%20Maps.
 - All of the BIG-IP VE members in the cluster are active and process traffic.  See [Detailed Clustering Information](#detailed-clustering-information).
 - This template supports service discovery.  See the [Service Discovery section](#service-discovery) for details.
 - After deploying the template, if you need to change your BIG-IP VE password, there are a number of special characters that you should avoid using for F5 product user accounts.  See https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873 for details.
 - After deploying the template, if you make manual changes to the BIG-IP configuration, you must see [this section](#important-if-you-make-manual-changes-to-big-ip-after-launching-the-template).
 - This template includes a master election feature, which ensures that if the existing master BIG-IP VE is unavailable, a new master is selected from the BIG-IP VEs in the cluster. As a part of this process, the template creates an IAM role-protected SQS queue (https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) for communication between the BIG-IP VEs, and encrypted credentials are sent on this queue. Additionally, the template creates public keys for the BIG-IP VEs and puts them in an S3 bucket in the public_keys folder. See [How this solution works](#how-this-solution-works) for more details.
 - This template can send non-identifiable statistical information to F5 Networks to help us improve our templates.  See [Sending statistical information to F5](#sending-statistical-information-to-f5).
 - F5 has created a matrix that contains all of the tagged releases of the F5 Cloud Formation Templates (CFTs) for Amazon AWS, and the corresponding BIG-IP versions, license types and throughputs available for a specific tagged release. See https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/aws-bigip-version-matrix.md.
 

## Launching the template using the AWS Launch Stack button
The easiest way to deploy this CloudFormation template is to use the Launch Stack button.<br>
**Important**: You may have to select the AWS region in which you want to deploy after clicking the Launch Stack button.

<br>


<sup>1</sup> Note about the Scaling Up/Down Thresholds:

The default template values are set artificially low for testing.<br>
The templates defaults are set to 80% and 20% respectively.<br> 
To adjust the thresholds,  set them according to the utility size (optional).<br> 
For example, if you wanted use different percentages in the scaling threshold(s), modify the ***.80*** or ***.20*** in the following calculations to represent the percentage you want to use. Then take the result and use that as the appropriate threshold value in the CFT.

*Scale Up Bytes Thresholds:* <br>
25 Mbps   = 3276800 bytes   * ***.80*** =   2621440<br>
200 Mbps  = 26214400 bytes  * ***.80*** =  20971520<br>
1000 Mbps = 131072000 bytes * ***.80*** = 104857600<br>
 
*Scale Down Bytes Thresholds:*<br>
25 Mbps   = 3276800 bytes   * ***.20*** =   655360<br>
200 Mbps  = 26214400 bytes  * ***.20*** =  5242880<br>
1000 Mbps = 131072000 bytes * ***.20*** = 26214400<br>

### Logging into the BIG-IP device

Once you have completed the template and the BIG-IP system instantiates *(estimated at about 20 minutes)*, use the following guidance to access the BIG-IP VE.

  - Find the IP address of the BIG-IP VE<br> You can find the BIG-IP IP address (Instance IP or Public IP) on the Instances tab of the Auto Scale group created by the template (From the AWS console, click **EC2 > Auto Scaling > Auto Scaling Groups > Instances tab > Instance ID**)

  - SSH to the Instance or Public IP address using the following syntax:<br>``` >ssh -i ~/.ssh/<YOUR-PRIVATE-SSH-KEY-HERE> admin@<INSTANCE IP> ```
  - Create a custom-admin user using the following syntax:<br> ``` #tmsh create auth user my-custom-admin partition-access add { all-partitions { role admin } } prompt-for-password```
 
  - Once you have accessed the BIG-IP using SSH, you can log into the BIG-IP web-based Configuration utility using: **https://(IP Address of the instance):8443**. 

<a name="note"></a>
<br>
**Note**: If you want access to the BIG-IP web-based Configuration utility, you must first SSH into the BIG-IP VE using the SSH key you provided in the template as described in this section.  You can then create a user account with admin-level permissions on the BIG-IP VE to allow access to the Configuration utility if necessary.  In this deployment, the BIG-IP Configuration utility port is 8443 by default.


You can now configure the BIG-IP VE as applicable for your configuration.  See the BIG-IP documentation for details (https://support.f5.com/csp/tech-documents)

<a name="manual"></a>
#### IMPORTANT: If you make manual changes to BIG-IP after launching the template
After you initially launch the template, if you make manual changes to the BIG-IP configuration, you must make a backup of your BIG-IP configuration and store the resulting UCS file in the S3 bucket created by the template to ensure the master election process functions properly.

  1. Backup your BIG-IP configuration (ideally the cluster primary) by creating a [UCS](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13132) archive.  Use the following syntax to save the backup UCS file:<br> ```# tmsh save /sys ucs /var/tmp/original.ucs```
  
  2. Store the UCS file in the S3 bucket created by the solution in folder called **/backup**.

---

## Service Discovery
This CloudFormation template now includes service discovery, which means the BIG-IP VE automatically updates pool members based on auto-scaled cloud application hosts. In the template, you enter information about your cloud environment, specifically the tag key and tag value for the pool members you want to include in service discovery, and then the BIG-IP VE programmatically discovers (or removes) members using those tags.

### Tagging
In AWS, you have two options for tagging objects that the service discovery feature uses. 
  - *Tag a VM resource*<br>
The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the primary NIC configured for the tagged VM.
  - *Tag a NIC resource*<br>
The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the tagged NIC.  Use this option if you want to use the secondary NIC of a VM in the pool.


The template first looks for NIC resources with the tags you specify. If it finds NICs with the proper tags, it does not look for VM resources. If it does not find NIC resources, it looks for VM resources with the proper tags.

**Important**: Make sure the tags and IP addresses you use are unique. You should not tag multiple AWS nodes with the same key/tag combination if those nodes use the same IP address.

To use service discovery, in the **WAF Virtual Service Configuration** section of the template, in the **Application Pool Tag Key** and **Application Pool Tag Value** fields, enter your Key and Value information. If you leave these fields at the default, the template does not use service discovery, and uses the value you include for the Application Pool DNS.  Note that if you enter both the Application Pool DNS value and the Key/Value information, the template only uses the Key/Value fields, which enables service discovery.

### Getting Help
While this template has been created by F5 Networks, it is in the **experimental** directory and therefore has not completed full testing and is subject to change.  F5 Networks does not offer technical support for templates in the experimental directory. For supported templates, see the templates in the **supported** directory.

**Community Support**  
We encourage you to use our [Slack channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for discussion and assistance on F5 CloudFormation templates. There are F5 employees who are members of this community who typically monitor the channel Monday-Friday 9-5 PST and will offer best-effort assistance. This slack channel community support should **not** be considered a substitute for F5 Technical Support. See the [Slack Channel Statement](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/slack-channel-statement.md) for guidelines on using this channel.

## Additional BIG-IP VE deployment and configuration details 

All BIG-IP VE instances deploy with a single interface (NIC) attached to a public subnet. This single interface processes both management and data plane traffic. The LTM provide advanced traffic management functionality. The CloudFormation template collects some initial deployment input parameters and creates an auto scale group of BIG-IP VEs. The instances parameters and configurations are defined by the Auto Scale group's *launch configuration*. The launch configuration is used to:

  - Set the BIG-IP system information: hostname, NTP, DNS settings, and so on.
  - Provision the LTM module: BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM)
  - Join the auto scale cluster
  - Deploy integration with EC2 Auto Scale and CloudWatch services for scaling of the BIG-IP tier.
  - Create an initial HTTP virtual server

The CloudFormation template uses the default **Good** image available in the AWS marketplace to license these modules (you can choose 1000, 200, or 25 Mbps). Once the first instance is deployed, it becomes the cluster primary and all subsequent instances launched will join a cluster primary to pull the latest configuration from the cluster. In this respect, you can make changes to the running configuration of this cluster and not have to manage the lifecycle of the configuration strictly through the Launch Configuration.  

#### Configuration Example <a name="config"></a>


The following is a simple configuration diagram deployment. 

![Configuration example](../images/config-diagram-autoscale-ltm-bigiq-nlb.png)





#### Detailed clustering information
This solution creates a clustered system with "AutoSync" enabled, so any change is immediately propagated throughout the cluster. Each cluster member instance reports "Active" and "Actively" processes traffic.  Although Autosync is enabled and technically you can make changes to any existing clustered member, for consistency we recommend you make any changes to the original, primary instance.

Note: There is no indication of the "primary" instance in the BIG-IP Configuration utility itself; this is simply an administrative designation in this deployment. To determine the primary instance, look for instance with *Scale-In Protection*.  You can find the Scale-In Protection value in AWS by clicking **Auto Scaling Groups** > *Click your Auto Scale group* > **Instances Tab**, and then under the Protected From tab, look for the instance with **Scale-In**.  

When the first auto scale instance is launched, a Device Group called "autoscale-group" is automatically created. 

Whenever a new instance is launched, it joins the cluster. If those instances are scaled down, they are removed from the cluster and the original instance remains. The cluster membership is updated once every 10 minutes and sends metrics every 60 seconds using [iCall](https://devcentral.f5.com/icall).

This deployment creates an initial BIG-IP configuration using an [iApp](https://devcentral.f5.com/iapps) that includes a basic virtual service (listening on 0.0.0.0:80).   

After the first instance is launched, you can log in and customize the configuration (for example add logging, and much more).

---

### How this solution works

The CloudFormation Template creates and leverages several AWS resources to support Auto Scale, including:

  - **S3 Bucket**<br>
    The S3 bucket acts as persistent storage for the cluster database. It contains:
      - *Records*<br>
      Records, named for the instance ID contain metadata for each instance. For example  ```{"privateIp":"10.0.11.190","mgmtIp":"10.0.11.190","hostname":"ip-10-0-11-190.ec2.internal","isMaster":true}```<br>
      Newly launched instances query this bucket for an existing cluster and use information found here to join the cluster. If it it the first member launched in the group, it creates a record with "isMaster":true. Otherwise, it enters itself as "isMaster":false.
      - *Public Keys*<br>
      Public keys for the BIG-IP VEs in the **public_keys** directory.
  - **IAM Role**<br>
  The IAM Role is used to create Instance Profile. The instance profile allows the auto scaled BIG-IP instances to access / update the S3 Bucket, query the Auto Scale Group, and upload metrics to Cloudwatch.
  
  - **SNS Topic**<br>
  The SNS topic is used to notify the admin via email of Scale Up / Down events.
  - **Cloudwatch Alarms**<br>
  These alarms are used to trigger scale Up / Down events.
  - **Auto Scale Group**<br>
  By default, the number of auto scaled instances is set to 1 and the maximum is set to 8. We recommend you launch the solution with 1 instance to start, and increasing this to at least two by [updating the stack](#restoring-or-upgrading-the-solution). 
  - **SQS Queue**<br>
  The SQS queue is used for cluster synchronization messages between cluster members.

---

### Restoring or upgrading the solution
Certain elements of this deployment can be updated with the CloudFormation stack itself. This is referred to as *Updating the Stack*. For instance, anything that causes the Auto Scale Launch Configuration to update, like changing the AMI IDs (to upgrade from one BIG-IP version to another), instance sizes, scaling thresholds, and many others, requires updating the stack. 
 
Clustering is only done within a Launch Configuration ID basis, so any changes that result in a new Launch Configuration ID require the following procedure.
 
Note: Steps 1 and 2 are not necessary if you have already saved the backup as described <a href="#manual">above</a>.
 
  1. Backup your BIG-IP configuration (ideally the cluster primary) by creating a [UCS](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13132) archive.  Use the following syntax to save the backup UCS file:<br> ```# tmsh save /sys ucs /var/tmp/original.ucs```
  
  2. Store the UCS file in the S3 bucket created by the solution in folder called **/backup**.
    
  3. Update the Stack in AWS (click **CloudFormation > Action > Update Stack**).  
 
  4. The first instance from the new Launch Config becomes the new cluster primary and looks for a UCS in that backup folder for the latest configuration. NOTE: It selects the UCS with the latest timestamp. All subsequent instances from that launch config then sync the latest configuration from the cluster primary as usual. 

---
### Removing the deployment

To remove the deployment, there are few objects that need to be removed manually before you can delete the stack associated with the clustered auto scale BIG-IP CloudFormation template.  

1. Remove Scale-In Protection 
You must first remove "Instance Teardown" Protection on one of the auto scaled instances launched. From the AWS Console, click **EC2 > Auto Scaling Groups >** *Select your BIG-IP auto scale Group* **> Instances Tab >** *Select the Instance with "Scale-In" in the "Protected From" Tab*.  Right Click or select the Actions Tab and then click **Instance Protection > Remove Scale-In Protection**

2. Delete the S3 Bucket
This deployment creates an S3 bucket using the following naming convention: *(your-deploymentName)-autoscale-bigip-s3bucket-52byo83nzxlu*.  To delete the S3 bucket, go to the S3 page in the AWS Console, and then click **Bucket > Empty Bucket**.


3. Delete the CloudFormation stack
In the AWS Console, navigate to the CloudFormation page, select the stack created with the f5-autoscale-bigip-ltm.template and delete the stack by right-clicking or (selecting the Actions tab) and then clicking **Delete Stack**.

---

### Sending statistical information to F5
All of the F5 templates now have an option to send anonymous statistical data to F5 Networks to help us improve future templates.  
None of the information we collect is personally identifiable, and only includes:  

- Customer ID: this is a hash of the customer ID, not the actual ID
- Deployment ID: hash of stack ID
- F5 template name
- F5 template version
- Cloud Name
- AWS region 
- BIG-IP version 
- F5 license type
- F5 Cloud libs version
- F5 script name
 
This information is critical to the future improvements of templates, but should you decide to select **No**, information will not be sent.

In order to form a cluster of devices, a secure trust must be established between BIG-IP systems. To establish this trust, we generate and store credentials in an Amazon S3 bucket. You must not delete these credentials from the S3 bucket.

---

## Security
This CloudFormation template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system. To verify the integrity of the template, you can open the CFT and ensure the following lines are present. See [Security Detail](#securitydetail) for the exact code in each of the following sections.
  - In the /config/verifyHash section: script-signature and then a hashed signature.
  - In the /config/installCloudLibs.sh section: **tmsh load sys config merge file /config/verifyHash**.
  - In the *filesToVerify* variable: ensure this includes **tmsh run cli script verifyHash /config/cloud/f5-cloud-libs.tar.gz**.
  
Additionally, F5 provides checksums for all of our supported Amazon Web Services CloudFormation templates. For instructions and the checksums to compare against, see https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github-1014.

In order to form a cluster of devices, a secure trust must be established between BIG-IP systems. To establish this trust, we generate and store credentials in an Amazon S3 bucket. You must not delete these credentials from the S3 bucket.
