# Deploying the BIG-IP in AWS - 2 NIC

[![Slack Status](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com)

## Introduction
 
This solution uses a CloudFormation Template to launch a 2-NIC deployment of a BIG-IP VE in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. In a 2-NIC implementation, one interface is for management and data-plane traffic from the Internet, and the second interface is connected into the Amazon networks where traffic is processed by the pool members in a traditional two-ARM design. Traffic flows from the BIG-IP VE to the application servers.

The **existing stack** CloudFormation template incorporates an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). If you would like to run a *full stack* which creates and configures the BIG-IP, the AWS infrastructure, as well as a backend webserver, see the templates located in the **learning-stacks** folder.

See the **[Configuration Example](#config)** section for a configuration diagram and description for this solution.

## Prerequisites
The following are prerequisites for the F5 2-NIC CFT:
  - An AWS VPC with three subnets: 
    - Management subnet (called Public in the AWS UI)
    - External subnet (called Private in the AWS UI) 
    - NAT instance and associated network interface for network translation.
  - Key pair for SSH access to BIG-IP VE (you can create or import in AWS)
  - An AWS Security Group with the following inbound rules:
    - Port 22 for SSH access to the BIG-IP VE
    - Port 8443 (or other port) for accessing the BIG-IP web-based Configuration utility
    - A port for accessing your applications via the BIG-IP virtual server

## Supported instance types and hypervisors
  - For a list of supported AWS instance types for this solutions, see the **Amazon EC2 instances for BIG-IP VE** section of https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-multi-nic-setup-amazon-ec2-12-1-0/1.html#guid-71265d82-3a1a-43d2-bae5-892c184cc59b

  - For a list versions of the BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) and F5 licenses that are supported on specific hypervisors and AWS, see https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/ve-supported-hypervisor-matrix.html.

### Help
We encourage you to use our [Slack channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for discussion and assistance on F5 CloudFormation templates.  This channel is typically monitored Monday-Friday 9-5 PST by F5 employees who will offer best-effort support.<br>
While this template has been created by F5 Networks, it is in the experimental directory and therefore has not completed full testing and is subject to change.  F5 Networks does not offer technical support for templates in the experimental directory. For supported templates, see the templates in the **supported** directory.

## Installation

You have two options for deploying this template: 
  - Using the AWS deploy buttons 
  - Using [CLI Tools](#cli)

### Using the AWS deploy buttons
The easiest way to deploy one of the CloudFormation templates is to use the appropriate Launch button.
 - Hourly, which uses pay-as-you-go hourly billing
 - [BYOL](#byol) (bring your own license), which allows you to use an existing BIG-IP license.
<br>

**Hourly deploy button**

Use this button to deploy the **hourly** template: 

<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=BigIp-2nic-Hourly&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/f5-cft/f5-existing-stack-hourly-2nic-bigip.template">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png"/>
</a>
<br>
<br>

After clicking the Launch button, you must specify the following parameters.
<br>

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| adminPassword | x | Type the BIG-IP admin password |
| adminUsername | x | Type the BIG_IP user name |
| bigipExternalSecurityGroup | x | Public or External Security Group ID |
| bigipManagementSecurityGroup | x | BIG-IP Management Security Group ID |
| imageName | x | F5 BIG-IP Performance Type |
| instanceType | x | BIG-IP virtual instance type |
| licenseKey1 | x | Type or paste your F5 BYOL regkey |
| managementSubnetAz1 | x | Management subnet ID |
| restrictedSrcAddress | x | The IP address range that can be used to SSH to the EC2 instances |
| sshKey | x | Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access to the instance |
| subnet1Az1 | x | Public or External subnet ID |
| Vpc | x | Common VPC for the deployment |

<a name="byol"></a>**BYOL deploy button**

Use this button to deploy the **BYOL** template: 

<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=BigIp-2nic-BYOL&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/f5-cft/f5-existing-stack-byol-2nic-bigip.template">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png"/>
</a>
<br>
After clicking the Launch button, you must specify the following parameters.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| adminPassword | x | Type the BIG-IP admin password |
| adminUsername | x | Type the BIG_IP user name |
| bigipExternalSecurityGroup | x | Public or External Security Group ID |
| bigipManagementSecurityGroup | x | BIG-IP Management Security Group ID |
| iamAccessKey | x | Type the IAM Access Key |
| iamSecretKey | x | Type the IAM Secret Key for BIG-IP |
| imageName | x | F5 BIG-IP Performance Type |
| instanceType | x | BIG-IP virtual instance type |
| licenseKey1 | x | Type or paste your F5 BYOL regkey here |
| licenseKey2 | x | Type or paste your F5 BYOL regkey here |
| managementSubnetAz1 | x | Management subnet ID |
| managementSubnetAz2 | x | Management subnet ID |
| restrictedSrcAddress | x | The IP address range that can be used to SSH to the EC2 instances |
| sshKey | x | Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access to the instance |
| subnet1Az1 | x | Public or External subnet ID |
| subnet1Az2 | x | Public or External subnet ID |
| Vpc | x | Common VPC for the deployment |

### Documentation
The ***BIG-IP Virtual Edition and Amazon Web Services: Multi-NIC Setup*** guide (https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-multi-nic-setup-amazon-ec2-12-1-0.html) details how to create the configuration manually without using the CloudFormation template.  This document also describes the configuration in more detail.

## Design Patterns


The goal is for the design patterns for all the iterative examples of F5 being deployed via ARM templates to closely match as much as possible.
