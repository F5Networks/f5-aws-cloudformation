## Introduction

This solution uses a CloudFormation Template to launch and configure two BIG-IP 2-NIC VEs in a clustered, highly available configuration across Amazon Availability Zones. The BIG-IP VE can detect Availability Zone failure and automatically shift public traffic to the BIG-IP in the Availability Zone that is unaffected. In a 2-NIC implementation, each BIG-IP VE has one interface used for management and data-plane traffic from the Internet, and the second interface connected into the Amazon networks where traffic is processed by the pool members in a traditional two-ARM design. Traffic flows from the BIG-IP VE to the application servers.  

When deploying this solution from the AWS Marketplace, you can launch the BIG-IP VE image (Good, Better, or Best) with the following throughput levels: 5Gbps, 1Gbps, 200Mbps, or 25Mbps. Each has a separate page, meaning there are 12 separate Marketplace pages for this solution.


See the [Configuration Example](#configuration-example) section for a configuration diagram and description for this solution.

## Prerequisites and configuration notes
The following are prerequisites for the F5 2-NIC CFT:
  - An existing AWS VPC with two separate Availability Zones, each with three subnets: 
    - Management subnet (called Public in the AWS UI). The subnet for the management network requires a route and access to the Internet for the initial configuration to download the BIG-IP cloud library. 
    - External subnet (called Private in the AWS UI). 
    - NAT instance and associated network interface for network translation. 
  - The AWS VPC must have **DNS Hostnames** enabled, and the VPC DHCP default option *domain-name = <region>.compute.internal domain-name-servers = AmazonProvidedDNS* is required.
  - Key pair for SSH access to BIG-IP VE (you can create or import the key pair in AWS), see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html for information.
  - An AWS Security Group in each Availability Zone with the following inbound rules:
    - Port 22 for SSH access to the BIG-IP VE.
    - Port 8443 (or other port) for accessing the BIG-IP web-based Configuration utility.
    - UDP port 1026 for failover heartbeat.
    - TCP port 4353 for ConfigSync.
    - A port for accessing your applications via the BIG-IP virtual server.
  - This solution uses the SSH key to enable access to the BIG-IP system(s). If you want access to the BIG-IP web-based Configuration utility, you must first SSH into the BIG-IP VE using the SSH key you provided in the template.  You can then create a user account with admin-level permissions on the BIG-IP VE to allow access if necessary.
  - This template supports service discovery.  See the [Service Discovery section](#service-discovery) for details.
  - After deploying the template, if you need to change your BIG-IP VE password, there are a number of special characters that you should avoid using for F5 product user accounts.  See https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873 for details.





## Security
This CloudFormation template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system. If you want to verify the integrity of the template, you can open the CFT and ensure the following lines are present. See [Security Details](#security-details) for the exact code in each of the following sections.
  - In the /config/verifyHash section: script-signature and then a hashed signature.
  - In the /config/installCloudLibs.sh section: **tmsh load sys config merge file /config/verifyHash**.
  - In the *filesToVerify* variable: ensure this includes **tmsh run cli script verifyHash /config/cloud/f5-cloud-libs.tar.gz**.
  
  Additionally, F5 provides checksums for all of our supported Amazon Web Services CloudFormation templates. For instructions and the checksums to compare against, see https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github-1014.
  Note that in order to form a cluster of devices, a secure trust must be established between BIG-IP systems. To establish this trust, we generate and store credentials in an Amazon S3 bucket.

## Supported instance types and hypervisors
  - For a list of supported AWS instance types for this solutions, see the **Amazon EC2 instances for BIG-IP VE** section of https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-multi-nic-setup-amazon-ec2-13-0-0/1.html

  - For a list versions of the BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) and F5 licenses that are supported on specific hypervisors and AWS, see https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/ve-supported-hypervisor-matrix.html.


### Help 
Because this template has been created and fully tested by F5 Networks, it is fully supported by F5. This means you can get assistance if necessary from [F5 Technical Support](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K25327565).
 
We encourage you to use our [Slack channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for discussion and assistance on F5 CloudFormation templates.  This channel is typically monitored Monday-Friday 9-5 PST by F5 employees who will offer best-effort support. 


## Quick Start for launching the template
This Readme file describes launching from the AWS Marketplace (see also [non-marketplace readme](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/supported/cluster/2nic/across-az-ha/readme.md)). You can deploy this solution using one of four different throughput values (25Mbps, 200Mbps, 1000Mbps, 5000Mbps) on one of three different BIG-IP performance types (Good, Better, Best). Use the appropriate AWS Marketplace page for the template you want to launch. 


From the Marketplace for the image you want to use: 
- From the **For Region** list, select your Region. 
- From the **Delivery Methods** list, select **HA across AZs via CFT**
- Click **Continue**
- Select either the **Hourly** or **Yearly** Subscription Term.
- Select the appropriate version.
- Click **Launch the CloudFormation template**.


**Template Parameters**<br>
Once you have launched the CFT from the marketplace, you need to complete the template by entering the required parameter values. The following table can help you gather the information you need before beginning the template.  



| CFT Label | Parameter Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VPC | Vpc | Yes | Common VPC for the deployment. |
| Management Subnet AZ1 | managementSubnetAz1 | Yes | Management subnet ID for Availability Zone 1. |

## Service Discovery
Once you launch your BIG-IP instance using the CFT template, you can use the Service Discovery iApp template on the BIG-IP VE to automatically update pool members based on auto-scaled cloud application hosts.  In the iApp template, you enter information about your cloud environment, including the tag key and tag value for the pool members you want to include, and then the BIG-IP VE programmatically discovers (or removes) members using those tags.

### Tagging
In AWS, you have two options for tagging objects that the Service Discovery iApp uses. Note that you select public or private IP addresses within the iApp.
  - *Tag a VM resource*<br>
The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the primary NIC configured for the tagged VM.
  - *Tag a NIC resource*<br>
The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the tagged NIC.  Use this option if you want to use the secondary NIC of a VM in the pool.


The iApp first looks for NIC resources with the tags you specify.  If it finds NICs with the proper tags, it does not look for VM resources. If it does not find NIC resources, it looks for VM resources with the proper tags. 

**Important**: Make sure the tags and IP addresses you use are unique. You should not tag multiple AWS nodes with the same key/tag combination if those nodes use the same IP address.

To launch the template:
  1.  From the BIG-IP VE web-based Configuration utility, on the Main tab, click **iApps > Application Services > Create**.
  2.  In the **Name** field, give the template a unique name.
  3.  From the **Template** list, select **f5.service_discovery**.  The template opens.
  4.  Complete the template with information from your environment.  For assistance, from the Do you want to see inline help? question, select Yes, show inline help.
  5.  When you are done, click the **Finished** button.
  
If you want to verify the integrity of the template, from the BIG-IP VE Configuration utility click **iApps > Templates**. In the template list, look for **f5.service_discovery**. In the Verification column, you should see **F5 Verified**.

## Configuration Example

The following is a simple configuration diagram for this clustered, 2-NIC deployment. In this diagram, the IP addresses are provided as examples. This solution creates the instances with the BIG-IP v13.0 AMI image, and uses IAM roles for authentication.<br>

## Security Details
This section has the entire code snippets for each of the lines you should ensure are present in your template file if you want to verify the integrity of the helper code in the template.

**/config/verifyHash section**

Note the hashes and script-signature may be different in your template. The important thing to check is that there is a script-signature line present in the location shown.<br>
