## Licensing Options
For each template, you have different options for licensing your BIG-IP VE(s).  Note that not all options are available for all templates.

  - **BYOL** <br>Bring your own license (BYOL) templates require you have a valid BIG-IP license token/key that you enter in the template.  Contact your F5 Sales representative to acquire BYOL licenses.

  - **PAYG** <br>Pay as you go (PAYG) templates allow you to use hourly licensing, so you do not need to have an existing F5 license.

  - **BIG-IQ** <br>[BIG-IQ](https://f5.com/products/big-iq-centralized-management) licensing templates use an existing BIG-IQ device with a License pool of BIG-IP VE BYOL licenses.  You must have a BIG-IQ and a pool of BIG-IP VE BYOL license to use these templates.
