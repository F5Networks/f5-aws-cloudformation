## Number of Network Interfaces
In many of our templates, you choose the number of network interfaces (NICs) you want your BIG-IP VE to include. Note that not all options are available for all templates. 

  - **2 NIC** <br>
  These templates deploy a BIG-IP with 2 NICs for use in environments with a separate management network.

  - **3 NIC** <br>These templates deploy a BIG-IP with 3 NICs for use in environments having a traditional enterprise architecture with separate management, external, and internal networks.
