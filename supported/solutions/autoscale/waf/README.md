# Auto scaling the BIG-IP VE Web Application Firewall in AWS
[![Slack Status](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com)

## Introduction
This project implements auto scaling of BIG-IP Virtual Edition Web Application Firewall (WAF) systems in Amazon Web Services using the AWS CloudFormation template **f5-autoscale-bigip.template**. As traffic increases or decreases, the number of BIG-IP VE instances automatically increases or decreases accordingly.

See the [Configuration Example](#config) section for a configuration diagram and more information for this solution.<br>
See the [Security Blocking Levels](#blocking) section for a description of the blocking levels for the Web Application Firewall presented in the template.

## BIG-IP deployment and configuration

All BIG-IP VE instances deploy with a single interface (NIC) attached to a public subnet. This single interface processes both management and data plane traffic.  The <a href="https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm">BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager</a> (LTM) and <a href="https://f5.com/products/big-ip/application-security-manager-asm">Application Security Manager</a> (ASM) provide advanced traffic management and security functionality. The CloudFormation template uses the default **Best 1000Mbs** image available in the AWS marketplace to license these modules.
The template performs all of the BIG-IP VE configuration and synchronization when the device boots using `Cloud-Init`. In general, Cloud-Init is used to:

- Set the BIG-IP hostname, NTP, and DNS settings
- Configure an IAM (Identity and Access Management) role with policies allowing the BIG-IP to make authenticated calls to AWS HTTPS endpoints.
- Create a HTTP virtual server with a Web Application Firewall policy
- Deploy integration with EC2 Auto Scale and CloudWatch services for scaling of the BIG-IP tier.

## Prerequisites
The following are prerequisites for this solution:
  - An AWS VPC with a public subnet, an ELB in front of the BIG-IP(s), and a DNS name for the application pool (which can be also be the DNS name of an ELB if using one behind the BIG-IP(s))  
  - Key pair for SSH access to BIG-IP VE (you can create or import in AWS)
  - An AWS Security Group with the following inbound rules:
    - Port 22 for SSH access to the BIG-IP VE
    - Port 8443 (or other port) for accessing the BIG-IP web-based Configuration utility
    - A port for accessing your applications via the BIG-IP virtual server
  - This solution uses the SSH key to enable access to the BIG-IP system(s). If you want access to the BIG-IP web-based Configuration utility, you must first SSH into the BIG-IP VE using the SSH key you provided in the template.  You can then create a user account with admin-level permissions on the BIG-IP VE to allow access if necessary.

## Security
This CloudFormation template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system. If your organization is security conscious and you want to verify the integrity of the template, you can open the CFT and ensure the following lines are present. See [Security Detail](#securitydetail) for the exact code in each of the following sections.
  - In the */config/verifyHash* section: **script-signature** and then a hashed signature
  - In the */config/installCloudLibs.sh* section **"tmsh load sys config merge file /config/verifyHash"**
  
Additionally, F5 provides checksums for all of our supported Amazon Web Services CloudFormation templates. For instructions and the checksums to compare against, see https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github-1014.

In order to form a cluster of devices, a secure trust must be established between BIG-IP systems. To establish this trust, we generate and store credentials in an Amazon S3 bucket. You must not delete these credentials from the S3 bucket.

### Help 
Because this template has been created and fully tested by F5 Networks, it is fully supported by F5. This means you can get assistance if necessary from F5 Technical Support via your typical methods.

We encourage you to use our [Slack channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for discussion and assistance on F5 CloudFormation templates.  This channel is typically monitored Monday-Friday 9-5 PST by F5 employees who will offer best-effort support. 

### Installation
Download the CloudFormation template from https://github.com/f5networks and use it to create a stack in AWS CloudFormation either using the AWS Console or AWS CLI

**AWS Console**

 From the AWS Console main page: 
   1. Under AWS Services, click **CloudFormation**.
   2. Click the **Create Stack** button 
   3. In the Choose a template area, click **Upload a template to Amazon S3**.
   4. Click **Choose File** and then browse to the **f5-autoscale-bigip.template** file.
 
 <br>
 **AWS CLI**
 
 From the AWS CLI, use the following command syntax:
 ```
 aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name Acme-autoscale-bigip --template-body file:///fullfilepath/f5-autoscale-bigip.template --parameters file:///fullfilepath/f5-autoscale-bigip-parameters.json --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`
```
<br>

## Configuration Example <a name="config"></a>

The following is a simple configuration diagram deployment. 

![Single NIC configuration example](images/config-diagram-autoscale-waf.png)

### Security blocking levels <a name="blocking"></a>
The security blocking level you choose when you configure the template determines how much traffic is blocked and alerted by the F5 WAF.

Attack signatures are rules that identify attacks on a web application and its components. The WAF has at least 2600 attack signatures available. The higher the security level you choose, the more traffic that is blocked by these signatures.

| Level | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low | The fewest attack signatures enabled. There is a greater chance of possible security violations making it through to the web applications, but a lesser chance of false positives. |
| Medium | A balance between logging too many violations and too many false positives. |
| High | The most attack signatures enabled. A large number of false positives may be recorded; you must correct these alerts for your application to function correctly. |

All traffic that is not being blocked is being used by the WAF for learning. Over time, if the WAF determines that traffic is safe, it allows it through to the application. Alternately, the WAF can determine that traffic is unsafe and block it from the application.
