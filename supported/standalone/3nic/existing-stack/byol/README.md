## Introduction
 
This solution uses a CloudFormation Template to launch a 3-NIC deployment of a BIG-IP VE in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, using BYOL (bring your own license) licensing.

This is an *existing stack* template, meaning the networking infrastructure MUST be available prior to deploying. See the Template Parameters Section for required networking objects. By default, the template will create and attach Public IP Address(es) to the BIG-IP interface(s). Where dictated by security policy or in deployments where accessing resources does not require a Public IP address on the BIG-IP VE, such as users connecting to internal applications using a VPN, set the **provisionPublicIP** parameter to 'No', which will not create Public IP Address(es).

Traffic flows from the BIG-IP VE to the application servers. This is the standard "on-premise like" cloud design where the compute instance of F5 is running with a management, front-end application traffic (virtual server), and a back-end application interface. The BIG-IP VE has the <a href="https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm">Local Traffic Manager</a> (LTM) module enabled to provide advanced traffic management functionality. This means you can also configure the BIG-IP VE to enable F5's L4/L7 security features, access control, and intelligent traffic management.

For information on getting started using F5's CFT templates on GitHub, see [Amazon Web Services: Solutions 101](http://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/aws/AWS_solutions101.html).

## Prerequisites
The following are prerequisites for the F5 3-NIC CFT:
  - An AWS VPC with three subnets: 
    - Management subnet (the subnet for the management network requires a route and access to the Internet for the initial configuration to download the BIG-IP cloud library)
    - External subnet (the subnet for the external network requires a route and access to the Internet for onboarding BIG-IP)
    - Internal subnet
  - Key pair for management access to BIG-IP VE (you can create or import the key pair in AWS), see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/upload-server-certificate.html for information. 
  - Because you are deploying the BYOL template, you must have a valid BIG-IP license token.
  
  
## Important configuration notes
  - All supported versions of F5 CloudFormation templates include Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) v3.18.0 on the BIG-IP VE.  As of release 4.1.2, all supported templates give the option of including the URL of an AS3 declaration, which you can use to specify the BIG-IP configuration you want on your newly created BIG-IP VE(s).  In templates such as autoscale, where an F5-recommended configuration is deployed by default, specifying an AS3 declaration URL will override the default configuration with your declaration.   See the [AS3 documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/) for details on how to use AS3.   
  - There are new options for BIG-IP license bundles. See the [the version matrix](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/aws-bigip-version-matrix.md) for details and applicable templates.  
  - Beginning with release 3.3.0, the BIG-IP image names have changed (previous options were Good, Better, and Best).  Now you choose a BIG-IP VE image based on whether you need [LTM](https://www.f5.com/products/big-ip-services/local-traffic-manager) only or All modules available (including [WAF](https://www.f5.com/products/security/advanced-waf), [AFM](https://www.f5.com/products/security/advanced-firewall-manager), etc.), and if you need 1 or 2 boot locations.  Use 2 boot locations if you expect to upgrade the BIG-IP VE in the future. If you do not need room to upgrade (if you intend to create a new instance when a new version of BIG-IP VE is released), use an image with 1 boot location.  See this [Matrix](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/matrix.html#amazon-web-services) for recommended AWS instance types.
  - This template creates AWS Security Groups as a part of the deployment. For the external Security Group, this includes a port for accessing your applications on port 80/443.  If your applications need additional ports, you must add those to the external Security Group created by the template.  For instructions on adding ports, see the AWS documentation.
  - This solution uses the SSH key to enable access to the BIG-IP system. If you want access to the BIG-IP web-based Configuration utility, you must first SSH into the BIG-IP VE using the SSH key you provided in the template.  You can then create a user account with admin-level permissions on the BIG-IP VE to allow access if necessary.
  - This solution uses an AMI image with BIG-IP v13 or later.
  - This template supports service discovery via the Application Services 3 Extension (AS3).  See the [Service Discovery section](#service-discovery) for details.
  - This template supports telemetry streaming via the F5 Telemetry Streaming extension (TS). See [Telemetry Streaming](#telemetry-streaming) for details.
  - In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers, after launching the template you must create a virtual server on the BIG-IP VE.  See [Creating a virtual server](#creating-virtual-servers-on-the-big-ip-ve).
  - After deploying the template, if you need to change your BIG-IP VE password, there are a number of special characters that you should avoid using for F5 product user accounts.  See https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873 for details.
  - This template can send non-identifiable statistical information to F5 Networks to help us improve our templates.  See [Sending statistical information to F5](#sending-statistical-information-to-f5).
  - This template supports disabling the auto-phonehome system setting via the allowPhoneHome parameter. See [Overview of the Automatic Update Check and Automatic Phone Home features](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K15000) for more information.
  - F5 has created a matrix that contains all of the tagged releases of the F5 Cloud Formation Templates (CFTs) for Amazon AWS, and the corresponding BIG-IP versions, license types and throughput levels available for a specific tagged release. See https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/aws-bigip-version-matrix.md.
  - These CloudFormation templates incorporate an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). If you would like to run a *full stack* which creates and configures the BIG-IP, the AWS infrastructure, as well as a backend webserver, see the templates located in the *learning-stacks* folder in the **experimental** directory.
  - F5 AWS CFT templates now capture all deployment logs to the BIG-IP VE in **/var/log/cloud/aws**. Depending on which template you are using, this includes deployment logs (stdout/stderr), Cloud Libs execution logs, recurring solution logs (metrics, failover, and so on), and more.    


## Security
This CloudFormation template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system. If you want to verify the integrity of the template, you can open the CFT and ensure the following lines are present. See [Security Details](#security-details) for the exact code in each of the following sections.
  - In the /config/verifyHash section: script-signature and then a hashed signature.
  - In the /config/installCloudLibs.sh section: **tmsh load sys config merge file /config/verifyHash**.
  - In the *filesToVerify* variable: ensure this includes **tmsh run cli script verifyHash /config/cloud/f5-cloud-libs.tar.gz**.
  
Additionally, F5 provides checksums for all of our supported Amazon Web Services CloudFormation templates. For instructions and the checksums to compare against, see https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github-1014.

## Supported instance types and hypervisors
  - For a list of supported AWS instance types for this solutions, see http://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/aws/AWS_singleNIC.html#amazon-ec2-instances-for-big-ip-ve.

  - For a list versions of the BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) and F5 licenses that are supported on specific hypervisors and AWS, see https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/ve-supported-hypervisor-matrix.html.

### Getting Help
**F5 Support**  
Because this template has been created and fully tested by F5 Networks, it is fully supported by F5. This means you can get assistance if necessary from [F5 Technical Support](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K25327565). You can modify the template itself if necessary, but if you modify any of the code outside of the lines ### START CUSTOM TMSH CONFIGURATION and ### END CUSTOM TMSH CONFIGURATION the template is no longer supported by F5.

**Community Help**  
We encourage you to use our [Slack channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for discussion and assistance on F5 CloudFormation templates. There are F5 employees who are members of this community who typically monitor the channel Monday-Friday 9-5 PST and will offer best-effort assistance. This slack channel community support should **not** be considered a substitute for F5 Technical Support. See the [Slack Channel Statement](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/slack-channel-statement.md) for guidelines on using this channel.

## Deploying the F5 3 NIC solution
You have two options for launching this solution:

<br>


### Installing the template using the AWS CLI
If you want to deploy the template using the AWS CLI(aws-cli/1.11.165), use the example **deploy_via_bash.sh** script available [in this repository](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/supported/standalone/3nic/existing-stack/byol/deploy_via_bash.sh). Replace the static items (or make them parameters).  

---

### Service Discovery

This template previously supported configuring service discovery using the f5.service_discovery iApp template.  That iApp has been deprecated and removed from this template.  You can now configure service discovery using the F5 AS3 extension, which is installed by all Cloudformation templates by default.  See the official AS3 [documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/userguide/service-discovery.html) and the iApp migration [guide](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/iapp-migration.md) for more information and examples.

### Telemetry Streaming

This template previously supported configuring device telemetry using the f5.cloud_logger iApp template.  That iApp has been deprecated and removed from this template.  You can now configure telemetry streaming using the F5 Telemetry Streaming extension.  See the official TS [documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/) and the iApp migration [guide](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/iapp-migration.md) for installation steps and examples.

## Creating virtual servers on the BIG-IP VE

In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers through the BIG-IP system, you must create a virtual server on the BIG-IP VE. To create a BIG-IP virtual server you need to know the AWS secondary private IP address. If you need additional virtual servers for your applications/servers, you can add more secondary private IP addresses in AWS, and corresponding virtual servers on the BIG-IP system. See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html for information on multiple IP addresses.

**To create virtual servers on the BIG-IP system**

1. Once your BIG-IP VE has launched, open the BIG-IP VE Configuration utility.
2. On the Main tab, click **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers** and then click the **Create** button.
3. In the **Name** field, give the Virtual Server a unique name.
4. In the **Destination/Mask** field, type the AWS secondary private IP address.
5. In the **Service Port** field, type the appropriate port. 
6. Configure the rest of the virtual server as appropriate.
7. In the Resources section, from the **Default Pool** list, select the name of the pool you want to use.
8. Click the **Finished** button.
9. Repeat as necessary.

## Configuration Example

The following is a simple configuration diagram for this 3-NIC deployment. In this diagram, the IP addresses are provided as examples.<br>
![3-NIC configuration example](../../images/aws-3-nic.png)

### More documentation
For more information on F5 solutions for AWS, including manual configuration instructions for many of our AWS templates, see our Cloud Docs site: http://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/.

### Sending statistical information to F5
All of the F5 templates now have an option to send anonymous statistical data to F5 Networks to help us improve future templates.  
None of the information we collect is personally identifiable, and only includes:  

- Customer ID: this is a hash of the customer ID, not the actual ID
- Deployment ID: hash of stack ID
- F5 template name
- F5 template version
- Cloud Name
- AWS region 
- BIG-IP version 
- F5 license type
- F5 Cloud libs version
- F5 script name

This information is critical to the future improvements of templates, but should you decide to select **No**, information will not be sent to F5.

## Security Details
This section has the entire code snippets for each of the lines you should ensure are present in your template file if you want to verify the integrity of the helper code in the template.

**/config/verifyHash section**

Note the hashes and script-signature may be different in your template. The important thing to check is that there is a script-signature line present in the location shown.<br>
